Naive Algorithms
----------------
There are various algorithms, which can be used for decompression
calculations. The ``decotengu.alt.naive`` module implements some of them,
i.e. calculation of decompression stop length using 1 minute intervals.

The algorithms are quite inefficient, usually :math:`O(n)` while algorithm
of complexity :math:`O(log(n))` could be used. They are implemented in
DecoTengu for comparison purposes only.

Decompression Stop Stepper
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The decompression stop stepper is simple algorithm to calculate length of
a decompression stop.

Decompression stop length is calculated by increasing length of the stop
by one minute until it is possible to ascend to next stop or to the
surface.

The algorithm is implemented by :py:class:`decotengu.alt.naive.DecoStopStepper`
class.

The complexity of the algorithm is :math:`O(n)`, where :math:`n` is length
of decompression stop in minutes.

    Such ascent simulation allows to avoid Schreiner equation, but is less
    accurate. The longer depth jump, the less accuracy. Do not use for
